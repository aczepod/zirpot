## Zirpot: another oh-my-zsh theme


![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirpo/zirpot/master/img/zirpot.png)


### Install


```
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes  #create the themes dir if it's not there
```

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cirpo/zirpot/master/zirpot.zsh-theme > zirpot.zsh-theme`
```

change the theme in your `zshrc`:

```
ZSH_THEME="zirpot"
```

### Why another one???

I couldn't find a theme that has the current time, PID number, git infos and the prompt on a new line.

Feel free to use it and send PRs :)
